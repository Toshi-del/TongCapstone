# Nurse Workflow Update - No Auto-Send to Doctor

## Overview
Updated the nurse examination workflow so that examinations are **not automatically sent to doctors** but doctors can still **view all examination data** created by nurses.

## Changes Made

### 1. **NurseController - Dashboard Method** (Line 63-64)
**Before:**
```php
$annualPhysicalCount = Patient::where('status', 'approved')
    ->whereDoesntHave('annualPhysicalExamination', function ($q) {
        $q->whereIn('status', ['completed', 'sent_to_company']);
    })
    ->count();
```

**After:**
```php
// Count all approved patients (nurses can work with all patients)
$annualPhysicalCount = Patient::where('status', 'approved')->count();
```

### 2. **NurseController - annualPhysical() Method** (Line 164-173)
**Before:**
```php
public function annualPhysical()
{
    // Only shows patients that haven't had their annual physical examination created yet
    $patients = Patient::with(['annualPhysicalExamination'])
        ->where('status', 'approved')
        ->whereDoesntHave('annualPhysicalExamination')
        ->latest()
        ->paginate(15);
    
    return view('nurse.annual-physical', compact('patients'));
}
```

**After:**
```php
public function annualPhysical()
{
    // Show all approved patients with their examination status
    // Nurses can see all patients regardless of examination completion
    $patients = Patient::with(['annualPhysicalExamination'])
        ->where('status', 'approved')
        ->latest()
        ->paginate(15);
    
    return view('nurse.annual-physical', compact('patients'));
}
```

### 3. **NurseController - opd() Method** (Line 716-725)
**Before:**
```php
public function opd()
{
    $opdPatients = User::with(['opdExamination'])
        ->where('role', 'opd')
        ->whereDoesntHave('opdExamination')
        ->latest()
        ->get();
    
    return view('nurse.opd', compact('opdPatients'));
}
```

**After:**
```php
public function opd()
{
    // Show all OPD patients with their examination status
    // Nurses can see all OPD patients regardless of examination completion
    $opdPatients = User::with(['opdExamination'])
        ->where('role', 'opd')
        ->latest()
        ->get();
    
    return view('nurse.opd', compact('opdPatients'));
}
```

### 4. **NurseController - storePreEmployment() Method** (Line 576-577)
**Before:**
```php
// Set status to make immediately visible to doctor
$validated['status'] = 'Approved';
```

**After:**
```php
// Set status to 'pending' - doctor can view but won't auto-appear in review queue
$validated['status'] = 'pending';
```

### 5. **NurseController - storeAnnualPhysical() Method** (Line 676-677)
**Before:**
```php
$validated['status'] = 'completed';
```

**After:**
```php
// Set status to 'pending' - doctor can view but won't auto-appear in review queue
$validated['status'] = 'pending';
```

### 6. **NurseController - storeOpdExamination() Method** (Line 779-780)
**Before:**
```php
$validated['status'] = 'completed';
```

**After:**
```php
// Set status to 'pending' - doctor can view but won't auto-appear in review queue
$validated['status'] = 'pending';
```

## New Workflow

### Nurse Perspective:
1. ✅ Nurses can see **all patients** in their lists (not just those without examinations)
2. ✅ After creating an examination, the patient **remains in the nurse's list**
3. ✅ Nurses can continue to edit and update examinations
4. ✅ Examinations are created with status `'pending'`

### Doctor Perspective:
1. ✅ Doctors can **view all examination data** created by nurses
2. ✅ Examinations with status `'pending'` are visible but **don't auto-appear in the review queue**
3. ✅ Doctors see examinations with status `'pending', 'completed', 'Approved'` in their views
4. ✅ Doctors can still review and submit examinations when ready

### Status Flow:
- **Nurse creates examination** → Status: `'pending'`
- **Doctor reviews (optional)** → Status: `'Approved'` or `'completed'`
- **Doctor submits to admin** → Status: `'sent_to_admin'`
- **Admin sends to company** → Status: `'sent_to_company'`

## Benefits

1. **No Automatic Workflow**: Examinations don't automatically trigger doctor review
2. **Nurse Visibility**: Nurses maintain visibility of all their work
3. **Doctor Access**: Doctors can still access and view all examination data
4. **Flexible Workflow**: Allows for more manual control over the examination review process
5. **Data Preservation**: All examination data remains accessible to authorized staff

## Technical Notes

- The `whereDoesntHave('examination')` filters have been removed from nurse list views
- Examination status is set to `'pending'` instead of `'Approved'` or `'completed'`
- DoctorController already supports viewing examinations with `'pending'` status (line 58)
- No changes needed to doctor views or other medical staff controllers
