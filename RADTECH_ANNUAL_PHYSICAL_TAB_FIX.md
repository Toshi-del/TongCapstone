# Radtech Annual Physical X-Ray Tab Fix

## Issue Fixed

**Examination Type Mismatch**
- **Problem**: Controller and view were filtering for `'annual-physical'` (hyphen) but database stores `'annual_physical'` (underscore)
- **Result**: Completed X-rays were not appearing in the "X-Ray Completed" tab

## Changes Made

### RadtechController.php

1. **Lines 140, 147**: Changed `'annual-physical'` → `'annual_physical'` in tab filtering queries
2. **Line 214**: Changed `'annual-physical'` → `'annual_physical'` in examination type variable
3. **Line 320**: Updated validation rule from `'in:pre-employment,annual-physical'` → `'in:pre-employment,annual_physical'`
4. **Line 322**: Updated validation rule from `'required_if:examination_type,annual-physical'` → `'required_if:examination_type,annual_physical'`
5. **Lines 342, 381**: Updated comparison from `'annual-physical'` → `'annual_physical'`

### annual-physical-xray.blade.php

1. **Line 46**: Changed `'annual-physical'` → `'annual_physical'` in "Needs Attention" tab count query
2. **Line 64**: Changed `'annual-physical'` → `'annual_physical'` in "X-Ray Completed" tab count query

## Tab Logic

### Needs Attention Tab
Shows patients who:
- Have status = 'approved'
- Do NOT have a medical checklist with `examination_type = 'annual_physical'` AND `chest_xray_done_by` filled

### X-Ray Completed Tab
Shows patients who:
- Have status = 'approved'
- HAVE a medical checklist with `examination_type = 'annual_physical'` AND `chest_xray_done_by` filled

## Test Results

```
✓ NO OVERLAP - Tabs are properly separated!

Needs Attention: 2 patients
- Kyle Tuazon (no checklist)
- Aiko Nakagawa (no checklist)

X-Ray Completed: 1 patient
- Paul Espiritu (chest_xray_done_by: Robert Chen)
```

## Verification

Run `php test_radtech_tabs.php` to verify:
- Patients appear in correct tab
- No overlap between tabs
- Counts are accurate

## Result

✓ Tabs are now properly separated
✓ Completed X-rays appear only in "X-Ray Completed" tab
✓ Tab counts are accurate
