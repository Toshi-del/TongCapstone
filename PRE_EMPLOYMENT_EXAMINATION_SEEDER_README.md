- ✅ HBsAg Screening
- ✅ HEPA A IGG & IGM
- ✅ Other Lab Tests

### 3. Radiologist Data (X-Ray)
- ✅ Chest X-Ray Result
- ✅ Chest X-Ray Findings
- ✅ Radiologist Name & Review Date

### 4. ECG Technician Data
- ✅ ECG Results
- ✅ ECG Date
- ✅ ECG Technician Name

### 5. Doctor Data (Physical Findings)
- ✅ Neck Examination
- ✅ Chest-Breast Axilla
- ✅ Lungs
- ✅ Heart
- ✅ Abdomen
- ✅ Extremities

- ✅ GUT
- ✅ Inguinal/Genital

## Prerequisites

Before running this seeder, ensure you have:

1. **Users with proper roles:**
   - At least one user with role `'nurse'`
   - At least one user with role `'pathologist'`
   - At least one user with role `'radiologist'` (optional)
   - At least one user with role `'ecg_tech'` (optional)

2. **Pre-Employment Records:**
   - At least 5 approved pre-employment records in the database
   - Run `PreEmploymentRecordSeeder` first if needed

## How to Run

### Option 1: Run Standalone
```bash
php artisan db:seed --class=PreEmploymentExaminationSeeder
```

### Option 2: Add to DatabaseSeeder
Add this line to your `DatabaseSeeder.php`:
```php
$this->call([
    // ... other seeders
    PreEmploymentExaminationSeeder::class,
]);
```

Then run:
```bash
php artisan db:seed
```

### Option 3: Fresh Migration with Seed
```bash
php artisan migrate:fresh --seed
```

## What to Test After Seeding

### 1. Doctor's View
Navigate to the doctor's pre-employment examination list and verify:
- ✅ All examinations are visible
- ✅ Patient information displays correctly
- ✅ Status shows as "Approved"

### 2. Doctor's Edit View
Open any examination and verify:
- ✅ **Medical History** shows nurse's data (illness, accidents, past medical history)
- ✅ **Skin Identification Marks** displays nurse's input
- ✅ **Visual Assessment** shows visual acuity and Ishihara test results
- ✅ **General Findings** displays nurse's findings
- ✅ **Laboratory Reports** show pathologist's results
- ✅ **Physical Findings** show doctor's examination data
- ✅ **Lab Findings** show radiologist's X-ray interpretation
- ✅ **ECG Results** show ECG tech's data

### 3. Data Preservation Test
1. Open an examination in the doctor's view
2. Verify all fields have data (no "Not recorded" messages)
3. Check that each section shows data from the appropriate medical staff
4. Confirm no data is missing or overwritten

### 4. Pathologist's View
Navigate to pathologist's pre-employment list and verify:
- ✅ Can see examinations
- ✅ Can update lab reports without overwriting nurse's data
- ✅ Nurse's data (skin marks, visual, etc.) remains intact after pathologist updates

## Expected Output

When you run the seeder, you should see:
```
Creating comprehensive pre-employment examinations...
Created examination #1 for John Doe
Created examination #2 for Jane Smith
Created examination #3 for Robert Johnson
Created examination #4 for Maria Garcia
Created examination #5 for David Lee
Pre-employment examinations seeded successfully!
```

## Data Samples

The seeder includes realistic sample data:

### Illness History Examples
- "No previous hospitalizations"
- "Hospitalized for appendectomy in 2018"
- "Admitted for pneumonia in 2020, fully recovered"

### Visual Acuity Examples
- "20/20 both eyes uncorrected"
- "20/20 both eyes with correction"
- "OD: 20/20, OS: 20/25 uncorrected"

### ECG Results Examples
- "Normal sinus rhythm, rate 72 bpm, normal axis, no ST-T changes"
- "Sinus rhythm, HR 68 bpm, normal ECG"

### Lab Results Examples
- "Normal"
- "Within normal limits"
- "No abnormalities detected"

## Troubleshooting

### Error: "No approved pre-employment records found"
**Solution:** Run the PreEmploymentRecordSeeder first:
```bash
php artisan db:seed --class=PreEmploymentRecordSeeder
```

### Error: "Required users (nurse, pathologist) not found"
**Solution:** Create users with proper roles or run UserSeeder:
```bash
php artisan db:seed --class=UserSeeder
```

### No data showing in doctor's view
**Solution:** 
1. Check that examinations have status 'Approved'
2. Verify the doctor's query includes 'Approved' status
3. Check that `pre_employment_record_id` is properly linked
